This folder contains results for the temperature, momentum, and bump-on-tail relaxation problems and a Jupyter notebook to load and plot them.
The data from from full MD runs have been downsampled for smoothing and compression purposes.
Other data is, in general, unmodified except for unit conversions as needed for consistency.
See the Jupyter notebook (Python3 required) for detailed descriptions of the information contained in this data set and representative plots.

The raw data (>10 GB) can be made available upon request.
